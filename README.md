Site Title: Coffee & Stuff

Group Members: Gen Fillipow and Yukino Nagasawa

The home page displays a list of all the products our site sells. The navigation bar at the top will automatically
scroll the user to the different sections, such as coffee, mugs, or makers. Each product has a name and a price.
At the very bottom of the home page there is an "about us" section which goes into detail about the people in charge
of the company as well as what the company is. When a user clicks on a product, the user will be redirected to a page
that shows a larger picture of the product as well as an order from to the right. When the user moves their mouse over
the image the image will increase in size and revert back to normal once the mouse moves away. When the user fills in
the order form the default mail client will be pulled up to send an email to the address "gfillipo@uci.edu."
However, if the user fails to give valid information in each form input when submitting, the form will not send the
form and show which cells need to be completed. Throughout the website there are many styling properties, such as
when you hover over an product image on the home page the opacity changes.
